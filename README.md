# 🧠 Breast Cancer Survival Prediction using ML  
Coursework for Machine Learning & Data Mining (5DATA002W.2)

## 📊 Project Overview  
This repository contains the complete machine learning pipeline for predicting **breast cancer mortality status** and **survival months** using the **SEER Breast Cancer dataset**. The project follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology and is structured into three Jupyter Notebooks covering:

- 📁 Data Understanding, Cleaning, and Preparation  
- 🤖 Classification Modeling & Hyperparameter Tuning  
- 🌳 Regression using Decision Trees & Ensemble Methods

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Scikit-learn ⚙️  
- Pandas & NumPy 📐  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊  
- Jupyter Notebook 📒  

## 📁 Notebook Structure
1. `1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`  
   - Data loading, cleaning, encoding, and feature selection.

2. `2_Classification_Models.ipynb`  
   - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors  
   - Model evaluation, cross-validation, and confusion matrices.

3. `3_Regression_Models.ipynb`  
   - Decision Tree Regressors (fully grown and pruned)  
   - Ensemble models and survival month prediction.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- 🎯 Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- 📈 Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score  

## 📌 Highlights
- ✅ Implemented voting-based ensemble classifier  
- ✅ Used feature scaling and label encoding  
- ✅ Visualized model performance and confusion matrices  
- ✅ Explored overfitting vs pruning in Decision Trees

## 📚 Dataset
- SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) breast cancer data  
- Preprocessed and anonymized for academic use
